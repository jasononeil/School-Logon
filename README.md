School Logon
============

This is a simple PyQT script that maps samba drives.  It allows you to enter a username and password and then attempts to use those credentials to map a pre-configured list of network shares.  It is designed to work on both Mac, Windows and Linux, but we'll see how we go.

Ultimately, I'd like to stop using Samba and use Sparkleshare instead.  But we'll see how we go :)
